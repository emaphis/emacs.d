emacs.d
=======

This is an Emacs config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

A setup that attempts to be modular. Modules are stored in the `custom` directory.

Essentially based on the vertico, consult, orderless, maginalia, embark, corfu galaxy.

Based on Technomancy's [Better Defaults](https://git.sr.ht/~technomancy/better-defaults)

With many ideas from:

    [BBatsov's settings](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d),

    [flyingmachine's settings](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d),

    [Emacs Live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live),

    [Zamansky's setup](https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs)

    [Protesilaos Stavrou's basic setup](https://protesilaos.com/codelog/2024-11-28-basic-emacs-configuration)

Including instructions on how to compile and install emacs on in local directories on Fedora Linux [install-fedora.md](./doc/install-fedora.md)

A handy key binding reference: [key-bind.org](./doc/key-bind.org) acsessible with the C-h C-d key combo.
