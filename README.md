emacs.d
=======

This is an Emacs config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

A setup that attempts to be modular.

Based on Technomancy's [Better Defaults](https://github.com/technomancy/better-defaults)
With many ideas from: 
    [BBatsov's settings](https://github.com/bbatsov/emacs.d),
    [flyingmachine's settings](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d),
    [Emacs Live](https://github.com/overtone/emacs-live),
    [Zamansky's setup](https://github.com/zamansky/using-emacs)
    [Zamansky's videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49kBWM3RQQ8)

Including instructions on how to compile and install emacs on in local directories on Fedora Linux [install-fedora.md](./doc/install-fedora.md)

A handy key binding reference: [key-bind.org](./doc/key-bind.org) acsessible with the C-h C-d key combo.

*Directories*
